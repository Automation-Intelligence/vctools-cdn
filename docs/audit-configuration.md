# Running Audits

The **New Audit** form on the main page lets you set up and launch a PLC code audit with just a few steps. 

## 1. Upload PLC Programs

Use the **Upload PLC Programs** drop zone to add one or more files for analysis.

- You can **click to browse** or **drag and drop** files directly into the upload area.    
- Currently, a maximum of **10 files** can be uploaded per audit.  

> **Note:** Currently only Rockwell `.L5X` files are supported. Additional PLC formats will be supported in the future.

## 2. Select Standards

Optionally expand the **Standards to Check** section to choose which standards will be applied.

- By default, all standards available for your project are selected.  
- Uncheck any that you do not wish to include.  
- You can view detailed information about each standard under the **Standards** tab.  

> **Note:** Future updates will allow finer-grained selection of individual checks within a standard for project or organization-specific audits.

## 3. Start the Audit

The **Start Audit** button will show the number of credits that will be used. Click to begin the audit.
 
- A progress bar will appear in the **Recent Audits** panel showing real-time status.  
- When complete, results will be displayed in the **Audit Results** table.

> **Tip:** You can continue working elsewhere on the site while the audit runs. Completed results are automatically saved and can be revisited at any time.
